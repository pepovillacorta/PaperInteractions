A. FOR FIRST LEARNING CONFIGURATION:

1. "getMeanRate.R" script get mean lever pressing probability for each type of stimulus and each session
2. run "First Learning Configuration.R" to get models and plots


B. FOR ASYMPTOTIC PERFORMANCE
Run "Asymptotic Performance.R" script


C. FOR GENERALIZATION SESSION
1. Run "FormatData.R" scritp to get data for generalization
2. Run "Generalization.R" scritp to get models and individual plots


D. FOR TG PROTOCOL
1. run "FormatData.R" scritp to get data
2. run "Generalization_TGProtocol" scritp to get models and individual plots

--------

B, C and D save individual panels. To merge into figure run "MergePanels&Edit.R"

--------

SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES
run "Remainder Configurations.R" script (need "overallRate.rds" file which is generated with "getMeanRate.R" script. If A point was already done the file is available)
